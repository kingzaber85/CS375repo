Hi
This is Maia
Commiting from a branch

The HILLS ARE ALIVE with the sound of muuuuusic
With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my hear with the sound of music 
My heart wats to sing every song it hears
My hear wants to beat like the wings of the birds that rise form the lakes to the trees

My hear wants to sigh like the chime that flies from the church on a breeze
To laugh like a brook as it trips and falls over stones on its way
To sing through the night like a lark who is learning to pray
I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
I know I will hear what I've heard before
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
And I'll sing once more

To laugh like a brook as it trips and falls over stones on its way
To sing through the night like a lark who is learning to prey
I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
I know I will hear what I've heard before
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
And I'll sing once more
